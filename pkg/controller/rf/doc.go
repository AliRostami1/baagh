// Package rf provides receiver and transmitter functionality for reading
// remote control codes and sending them out to control remote controlled
// outlets.
//
// Most of the receiver and transmitter code as well as the protocols were
// ported from the rc-switch c++ implementation to go. Check out the rc-switch
// repository at https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch for the awesome work.
//
// This code is imported from https://github.com/martinohmann/rfoutlet and tweaked
// to use the core package instead
